    <h1>Maximizing Growth at Couchsurfing &#127793;</h1>
    <img src="growth/dolores.png" class="img-lg" alt="At the park with a group of Couchsurfers">
    
    <h3>The Focus: User Acquisition</h3>
    <p>Couchsurfing requires a large and active community to be successful - how do we ensure it continues to grow and thrive?</p>
    <div id="divergence-row">
        <img src="growth/divergence-1.png" class="img-sm" alt="a design thinking chart summarizing steps of my process through convergence and divergence of ideas">
        <img src="growth/divergence-2.png" class="img-sm">
    </div>
    <p>In the above diagram, I map out the design thinking process we followed to victory on  this project.</p>
    
    <h3>Preliminary Research</h3>
    <p>Kicking off the new focus on member acquisition was a data-gathering phase. We invited a few couchsurfers into the office for interviews, distributed a mass survey, and dove into our rich trove of analytics data.</p>
    <p>One startling statistic? <strong>Only 11% of people who reached the Couchsurfing homepage went on to become members.</strong>  How can we get the rest to take that next step?</p>
    <img src="growth/funnel.png" class="img-md" alt="a chart demonstrating that each step in the sign-up process causes significant drop-off">
    
    <h3>Our Hypothesis</h3>
    <p>If we remove a step from the sign-up funnel, then total conversion will increase.</p>
    
    <h3>Competitive Research</h3>
    <p>As a lean organization with only two designers and over 25 million members, we place an emphasis on analyzing our resource-rich competitors and adopting industry best practices. Through competitive research I found a number of sites that use their homepage as a sign-up page:</p>
    <img src="growth/competitive.png" class="img-md" alt="Facebook and Github have sign-up fields on their homepages">
    <p>In contrast to these community-driven sites; our homepage overwhelmed members with testimonials, safety guides, and photos.  This obfuscated our "Join" call-to-action.</p>
    
    <h3>Designing a Solution</h3>
    <p>[some images of paper sketches]</p>
    <img src="growth/final.png" class="img-lg" alt="the final design for the CS home page">
    <ul>
        <li>Information that was previously on the homepage has been moved to separate pages to provide a clear hierarchy</li>
        <li>Links to those pages are discoverable: occupying the desirable upper-right-hand corner</li>  
        <li>A step in the account creation funnel is brought to the front, giving the page a clear purpose</li>
        <li>Measuring with <a>a handy tool I created</a> using Google Analytics data, the "Join" call-to-action appears above-the-fold for most visitors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By dialing in the amount of content presented to prospective members, we were able to ensure that our most important information was properly highlighted and visible.  <a href="https://medium.com/@chalen/material-redesign-for-the-uga-app-4cc230dca408" target="_blank">My solution for another app I helped to design accomplished a similar goal.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Validation</h3>
    <p>On the qualitative side, I ran five user testing sessions collecting prospective member’s thoughts on a Marvel prototype of the new page.</p>
    <p>For qualitative data, I worked with developers to launch an A/B/C test on our production server.  I monitored sign-up conversions as well as key guardrail metrics.</p>
    <p><strong>With the winning variant implemented, Couchsurfing has seen a 21% increase in prospective members who went from browsing the homepage to becoming couchsurfers.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite things about leading design for Couchsurfing’s web product is the intimacy with which I can involve myself in every step of the product cycle. During this project alone I was able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify a fruitful opportunity through first-hand analysis of our data and conversations with prospective members</li>
        <li>Design a scientific experiment with a hypothesis, multiple variants, and quantifiable variables/constants</li>
        <li>Create and iterate upon variant wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes</li>
        <li>Collaborate with web developers to deploy and monitor the variants</li>
        <li>Execute upon the experiments’ outcome and prescribe follow-ups</li>
    </ul>
