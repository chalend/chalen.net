            <p>“Chalen is a strong user centric designer  - he is adept at effectively using user interviews, behavior, and UX best practices to identify various solutions to a design problem, and forming a strong perspective on the best path forward to get an intended outcome. Chalen also is a team player, and brings forward outside ideas to help the team towards broader objectives - in working with him he drove us to run our first Design Sprint that achieved great outcomes, from both a business and a team collaboration sense.  In addition to these great design skills, Chalen is fun to work with and brings a positive energy to any team.”</p>
